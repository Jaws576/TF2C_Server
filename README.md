# Team Fortress 2 Classic Server Template

Team Fortress 2 Classic is a re-imagining of the 2008 era of the original, adding in old features that were scrapped and working upon them or
adding new content such as weapons and game modes.

This repository contains a server template for my personal TF2C server network, though others may attempt to use it as they please.
